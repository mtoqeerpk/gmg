**5.1 Loading SEGY data**
-------------------------

To load observed SEGY data select the *'SEGY'* menu in the Menubar.
Next Navigate to the file you want to load and select it.
The file will automatically be loaded into the canvas.

.. note::
    SEGY data is loaded using the obspy.SEGY.core routine. This requires that all time/date SEGY headers have values,
    so these may need to be set using seismic processing software or obspy if they are not present in your data.

    The SEGY file will be plotted as a pyplot image.
