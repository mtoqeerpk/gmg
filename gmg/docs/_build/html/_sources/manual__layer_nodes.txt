====================
**2.0 Model Layers**
====================

|

------------------
2.1 Adding a layer
------------------

To add a new layer to the model navigate to the *'Layers'* menu and select *'New Layer'*.

.. tip:: the *n* key is the keyboard shortcut for adding a new layer.

You will be prompted with the option of adding a *'New fixed layer'* or a *'New floating layer'*.

**Floating layers:**

Floating layers are polygons that are fully contained within the model space.

**Fixed layers:**

Fixed layers span the entire width of the model and are useful for modelling features such as sedimentary basins.
Fixed layers have fixed boundary nodes that can only be moved vertically along the model edges.
These layers are padded horizontally from the boundary nodes an additional 400 km in order to avoid edge effects.

2.2 Adding a New Node to a Layer
--------------------------------
To add a node to a layer place the mouse cursor at the position where you would like to add the new node and
press the *'i'* key to insert the new node.

.. Note:: Nodes are inserted to the right of the currently selected node.

--------------------------------
2.3 Deleting a Node From a Layer
--------------------------------
To delete a node from a layer place the mouse cursor over the node you would like to delete and
press the *'d'* key to delete the new node.

------------------
2.4 Pinching nodes
------------------
To "pinch" a node onto a node of another layer: Press the *p* key to activate pinch mode.
Now select the node you wish to pinch, then switch to the layer which you would like to pinch
to, finally click on the node to pinch to.

Alternatively, multiple nodes can be pinched or depinched simultaneously to the layer above or below
(as defined in the layer order list) by selecting *'pinch layer'* in the Menubar.
A distance range over which to pinch/depinch nodes is then required.
